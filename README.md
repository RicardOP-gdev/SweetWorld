## Description


Sweet World is a project with the purpose of creating a Serious Game for the Museo del Chocolate BCN in which through QR codes the user could unlock a minigame referring to the museum's sculptures. This project was created with Unity3D and C# and uses gyroscope and accelerometer technology to control player. 

In this project I was Lead Programmer and Artist2D to make sprites for the UI and GUI, also create videos about museum information.
